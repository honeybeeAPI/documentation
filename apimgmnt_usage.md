#Creating an application
The first thing you should do after logging into the environment is create an application. You can create multiple applications, but you probably are building one app for the hackaton. An application holds the keys needed to call APIs.

Be sure to give your application a clear name, because this name will be provided on the user consent screen.

The next screen will contain some details. Please read the annotations

After the application is created you can still see the client id (API key) in the Applications view :

There is no need to attach APIs to a specific application. All APIs can be used to a maximum of 10.000 call's per day. If you need more, please contact the team.
